JavaScript-to-Native LLVM Compiler and Runtime

Proof-of-concept / demonstration to be able to compile JavaScript down to native code using LLVM.

NOTE: This is an almost complete ECMA 5.1 implementation which uses a refactored variation of the JavaScriptCore lexer and parser, but keep in mind that this has absolutely no production value at the moment and the runtime needs much more work to even be considered.
